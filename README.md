# Challenge-5-Workday-planner

## This challenge features a simple workday planner for a user who wants to organize their day so that they can be more production and work more efficiently. 
## Depending on the time of day, the background color of the text areas within the planner will change color. For example, if you look at the planner at 8AM on Tuesday you will see that all of the text areas will appear green to denote the future. If you were to look at it at 9AM it will appear the color red, to denote the present, and once that time passes to a new hour, it will appear grey to denote the past. 
## Local storage was also utilized in the creation of this app. The user is able to enter content into the text area and click the save button, which will then save the content to local storage and then repopulate upon reopening the app. 
## Resources I used for this app are...
* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery
* Day.js
* JavaScript
* I also consulted my colleagues for guidance in completion of this assignment, as well as tutoring sessions and attending office hours.
